# sw-spending
This project is a coding exercise demonstrating full-stack concepts including a backend-for-frontend that fetches and transforms data from a 3rd party API, and a client site that displays data via a charting library. 

# Project Setup
To run the code locally, navigate to each of the server and client folders in a command line interface.

within `server` run:

```
npm i
npm run build
npm start
```

and within `client` run:

```
npm i
npm start
```

### Note on Node

This project was developed using Node v20. If issues arise using earlier versions, I suggest using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) which provides an easy interface for temporarily switching Node environments.
